Nupic Pong 

A modified pong game written in pygame using Nupic OPF to create predictions

Coordinates are sent to the OPF when the ball hits either player 1, player 2(AI), or the top and bottom walls. 
Nupic creates a prediction and sends this to Player 2(AI). 
The Y axis is all that is changed to move the paddle/bat up or down
