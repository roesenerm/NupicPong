Nupic Pong 

A modified pong game written in pygame using Nupic OPF to create predictions

1. Coordinates are sent to the OPF when the ball hits either player 1, player 2(AI), or the top and bottom walls. 

2. Nupic creates a prediction and sends this to Player 2(AI). 

3. The Y axis of player 2(AI) is changed to move the paddle/bat up or down
